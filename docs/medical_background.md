🩺 Medical Background: Liver Disease Overview
الخلفية الطبية: نظرة عامة على أمراض الكبد

The AiLDS system is designed to navigate the complex progression of liver pathologies. To understand the logic of our models, it is essential to distinguish between the different types of liver stressors.

1. Viral Hepatitis (التهاب الكبد الفيروسي)
1.1 Hepatitis C (The Primary Target)
Hepatitis C is currently the most significant viral threat to liver health. It operates on RNA, making it biologically distinct from other types.


Primary Cause of Cancer: It is a direct and leading cause of liver cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma).


Data Availability: Because it does not directly involve the human DNA, it offers more plentiful and ethically sharable datasets while maintaining high patient privacy.

Focus: This virus is the target of our Hepatitis & Fibrosis Staging models.

1.2 Scope Justification: Why not A, B, or E?

Hepatitis A & E: These are generally mild, self-limiting infections. The human body often clears them naturally without medical intervention, and patients frequently remain asymptomatic. Consequently, specific laboratory diagnostic data for these types is scarce.


Hepatitis B: This virus operates on the DNA level. Finding reliable public data for Hepatitis B is extremely difficult due to strict confidentiality protocols. Since DNA markers can trace an individual's identity, ancestry, and family tree, there are severe legal and ethical restrictions on sharing such data online.

2. Liver Fibrosis: The "Remaining Scar" (تليف الكبد)
Fibrosis represents the body's "faulty healing" process. When chronic inflammation from Hepatitis C persists, the liver attempts to repair itself. Instead of building healthy cells, the body generates tough, fibrous scar tissue.

Stages of Progression:

Stage 1 (Portal Fibrosis): Mild scarring; liver function remains stable.


Stage 2 (Few Septa): Moderate scarring; a critical warning phase where risks begin to rise.


Stage 3 (Many Septa): Advanced scarring with bridges of damaged tissue connecting liver sections.


Stage 4 (Cirrhosis): Complete liver scarring where the organ becomes hard and loses its shape; this is the highest risk of mortality.

3. Fatty Liver Disease (الكبد الدهني)
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/MASLD) is identified through biochemical markers rather than just physical measurements.


Rule-Based Detection: Our system focuses on the Biochemical Footprint (ALT, GGT, and Triglycerides).


Metabolic Indicators: High levels of lipids and inflammation markers serve as a 95% accurate indicator of fatty liver without the need for physical biopsy.

4. Liver Cancer Risk (سرطان الكبد)
The final stage of the pipeline assesses the probability of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.


Risk Assessment: The model evaluates 7 pathological states and lifestyle factors.


Lifestyle vs. Genetics: Our research highlights Epigenetics; a healthy lifestyle can significantly mitigate genetic risks, whereas smoking and alcohol can spike the risk to 99.8% regardless of genetic predisposition.
